## About this Project
This project is an extension of the [PA-Cancer-Immunotherapy-Transformer](https://github.com/tomickristina/PA-Cancer-Immunotherapy-Transformer.git).

Please refer to that repository for all further details.

## Credits
This project builds upon the code of [GTE](https://github.com/uta-smile/GTE.git) 

## Functionality 
The scripts and files in this project are not intended to be used as out-of-the-box solutions. 
Instead, they serve as a workbench for conducting analyses, running experiments, and training models. 
They are designed to provide a flexible environment for research and experimentation, rather than offering a fully integrated or user-ready implementation.
